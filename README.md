### Hi! I'm Gurki 🏳️‍🌈

I'm currently studying Mathematics and computer science at WWU Münster (NRW, Germany).

This is where I occasionally post private projects I'm working on.
My primary languages at the moment are Haskell and Java.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on Twitter or Discord (see Bio or linktree).
